# Scripts Layout

This directory is split by platform:

1. `windows/`: PowerShell and CMD implementations.
2. `linux/`: bash implementations for Linux/WSL.
3. Top-level `scripts/*.ps1` and `scripts/*.sh`: compatibility wrappers that call into the platform directories.

When adding a new automation flow:

1. Add the implementation under `scripts/windows/` and `scripts/linux/` when applicable.
2. Add/update the top-level wrapper so legacy command paths keep working.
3. Update `README.md` and `docs/verification-plan.md` if usage or behavior changes.
